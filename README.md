### Breast cancer Description
--------------------------------------------

**Data Set Characteristics:**

    :Number of Instances: 569

    :Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

    :Attribute Information:
        - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
        - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
        - perimeter
        - area
        - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
        - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
        - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
        - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
        - symmetry 
        - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

        - class:
                - WDBC-Malignant
                - WDBC-Benign
                
  * Following things will be covered in ipynb file:
                
      1. Prediction by using a simple ANN model and its evaluation.
      2. Implementing Early Stopping to avoid overfitting of the model.
      3. addition of Dropout layers to avoid the overfitting of the model.
